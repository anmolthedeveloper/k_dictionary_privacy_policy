Thank you for using **k_dictionary** (the "App").

This Privacy Policy explains how our dictionary application handles user data.  
We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a safe experience.

## 1. Information We Collect

The App **does not collect**, store, or share any personal information from users.

We do not ask for:
- Name
- Email address
- Contact information
- Device identifiers

No personal data is collected in the background or transmitted to our servers.

## 2. Use of Third-Party APIs

The App uses a **public dictionary API** to fetch word meanings and related information.  
When you search for a word, the App sends that **word query** to the dictionary API, and the API returns the result.

### What is sent:
- Only the **word you want to look up**

### What is **not** sent:
- Any personal or device information

The third-party API may have its own privacy policy.  
We recommend reviewing it if needed.

## 3. No Data Storage

The App does not store search history or any data on our servers.  
All data is fetched live and displayed only within the App.
